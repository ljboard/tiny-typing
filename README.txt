Project 3: Tiny Typing

For this project, I created a text entry method for a smartwatch. The size of the touch area is 1 inch by 1 inch. 

To be considered for the assignment, text entry accuracy had to be above 95%. In addition, we needed to optimize for speed, aiming for 8 words per minute. The character set includes 'a' through 'z' and ' ' (space). No caps, numbers, or punctuation are currently included.
